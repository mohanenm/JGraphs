<h3>Discuss the differences among the results.</h3>
 
BreadthFirst and Closest have the same order resulting iteration sequence
Depth has the opposite of breadth. With random the resulting iteration sequence yielded is unique each time.

Does the starting point make a difference?
starting point does matter.
Using JGraphT's GreedyColoring or other coloring algorithm, find out how many colors are required to color your map in such a way that no two adjacent countries have the same color. That is, generate and print the coloring. Fun fact: For any idealized map (planar graph), this requires at most four colors.

Written part: Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.
